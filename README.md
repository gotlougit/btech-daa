# B.Tech Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Assignments

This is just a small repo of the implemented algorithms as covered in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course taught in NIT Kurukshetra.

The algorithms themselves are slight modifications (only wherever needed) from the pseudocode given in Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.
